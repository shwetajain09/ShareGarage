	<b>3) How can we earn more book coins?</b>
<br/>Remember SHARING IS CARING. So the more you share the more BC you earn. BUT Please remember, As soon as your 1st book gets placed on the bookshelf, we give you a BC but after that you'll earn the BC only when you physically handover the book to another book lover and not just by placing your book on the bookshelf.
